# yournextrole
This is a very silly project that I'm making because it's been a while since I made a website.

Word data is scraped from https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_agent_nouns
and http://home.alphalink.com.au/~umbidas/homonym_main.htm .

To run it, you need to create a file called yournextrole/localsettings.py and
set at least SECRET_KEY and DATABASES. The database needs to be a postgres db.
